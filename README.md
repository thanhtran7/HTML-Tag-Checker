# HTML-Tag-Checker
Developed using stack method in C# in Visual studio. This application checks .html file to see if apprioprate tags are closed. Lot's to improve upon and I look forward to the feedback :).

Quickly made to be simple and rough, working towards comeplety revamping the code to get familiar with GitHub.
